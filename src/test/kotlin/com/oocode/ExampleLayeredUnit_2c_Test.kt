/*
A variant of ExampleE2e_b_Test - the difference being here we are not testing that the
report is written to "System.out", but just directly testing the report String.

Advantages compared to ExampleE2e_b_Test:
    Makes the test easier to read an write - less extraneous noise

Disadvantages compared to ExampleE2e_b_Test:
    Means we have to expose a method "report" which might not otherwise need to exist
